FAF Mod - V3

## Why
I felt the FA ACU Upgrade wasn't celebrated enough.

### What
A bit of M People sillyness when ACU upgrades are actioned.

#### Mod effects
No gameplay changes - just visual/audio delights.

### Building
cd tools
.build.bat

Should now have a /dist directory in the root folder

### Deploying to user mods directory during dev
cd tools
.deploy.bat

Should copy files to your games directory; may need modifying on your machine.

### Uploading to FAF

Build, then take /dist/..zip and upload to FAF client/server
